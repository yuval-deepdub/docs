## Overview

The Deepdub Cursor Skill gives the AI agent in [Cursor](https://cursor.com) full knowledge of the Deepdub API, SDKs, voice presets, and coding conventions. When activated, the agent can write Deepdub integration code, generate TTS calls, manage voices, and follow Deepdub best practices — without needing to look up the docs.

## Installation

Create the skill directory in your project and add the `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/skills/deepdub-api
```

Then create `.cursor/skills/deepdub-api/SKILL.md` with the content from the **Skill file** section below.

## Skill file

The `SKILL.md` file contains the full Deepdub API reference in a format Cursor understands. It includes:

- **Base URLs** — US, EU, and WebSocket endpoints
- **Authentication** — API key format and free trial key
- **REST endpoints** — TTS generation, voice management, gender detection
- **Python SDK** — `pip install deepdub` with sync/async examples
- **JavaScript SDK** — `npm install @deepdub/node` with WebSocket and HTTP examples
- **Error codes** — 400, 401, 402, 403, 404, 429, 500 with meanings
- **Voice presets** — common preset IDs for quick testing
- **Rate limits** — concurrent request limits

### Frontmatter

```yaml
name: deepdub-api
description: >-
  Deepdub Text-to-Speech API reference for building TTS integrations.
  Use when the user writes code that calls the Deepdub API, uses the
  Deepdub Python/JS SDK, generates speech, manages voices, classifies
  gender, or mentions deepdub, TTS, text-to-speech, or voice cloning.
```

### Key sections

**TTS request body:**

```json
{
  "model": "dd-etts-3.0",
  "targetText": "Hello world",
  "locale": "en-US",
  "voicePromptId": "bd1b00bb-be1c-4679-8eaa-0fcbfd4ff773"
}
```

**Python SDK:**

```python
from deepdub import DeepdubClient
client = DeepdubClient(api_key="YOUR_KEY")
audio = client.tts(
    text="Hello", voice_prompt_id="...",
    model="dd-etts-3.0", locale="en-US",
)
```

**JavaScript SDK:**

```javascript
const { DeepdubClient } = require("@deepdub/node");
const deepdub = new DeepdubClient("YOUR_KEY");
await deepdub.connect();
const buffer = await deepdub.generateToBuffer("Hello", {
  locale: "en-US",
  voicePromptId: "...",
  model: "dd-etts-3.0",
});
```

## How it works

Once installed, the Cursor agent automatically activates this skill when you:

- Write code that imports `deepdub` or `@deepdub/node`
- Ask about TTS, text-to-speech, or voice cloning
- Reference voice prompts or the Deepdub API
- Work on gender detection audio classification

The agent will use the correct endpoints, default model (`dd-etts-3.0`), proper authentication headers, and real voice preset IDs from the skill.

## Example prompts

After installing the skill, try asking Cursor:

- *"Generate TTS audio with the Storyteller voice and save to file"*
- *"Add accent blending to this TTS call — mix French into English at 30%"*
- *"Classify the gender of speaker in this audio file using the Deepdub API"*
- *"Stream TTS audio in real-time using the JavaScript SDK"*
