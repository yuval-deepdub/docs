## API keys

All Deepdub API requests require authentication via an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header.

```bash
curl -X POST https://restapi.deepdub.ai/api/v1/tts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```

### Key format

API keys follow the format `dd-{random_characters}{checksum}`, where:

- The key always starts with the `dd-` prefix
- The last 8 characters are a checksum for validation

### Obtaining an API key

Contact [support@deepdub.ai](mailto:support@deepdub.ai) or visit your Deepdub dashboard to generate an API key.

### Security best practices

<Warning>
  Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories. Always store keys in environment variables or a secrets manager.
</Warning>

- Store API keys in environment variables (e.g., `DEEPDUB_API_KEY`)
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use different keys for development and production environments

## Rate limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your subscription plan:

| Limit type | Default |
|------------|---------|
| Concurrent requests per customer | 5 |
| Concurrent requests per IP | 3 |

Rate limit errors return a `429` status code or a WebSocket error with `errorType: "RateLimit"`.

## Credits

TTS generation consumes credits based on the duration of generated audio. If your account runs out of credits, requests will return an `InsufficientCredits` error.

Check your credit balance in the Deepdub dashboard, or contact support to upgrade your plan.
